      <h2>Game Story</h2>
      <p>"In the year 745 AD, during the fourth year of the Tianbao era in the Tang Dynasty, a significant event took
        place in August. Yang Yuhuan was officially bestowed the title of Yang Guifei, marking the beginning of her
        ten-year period of favor and influence. It was also in this same year that An Lushan received an imperial order
        to enter the court and meet the Emperor in Chang'an. The prosperity of Chang'an once again ignited his ambitious
        desires, but the might of the Tang Dynasty's elite forces, known as the Tiancefu, astounded him. He had never
        imagined that the Tang Dynasty possessed such a formidable military. In order to achieve his goals, An Lushan
        simultaneously persuaded Yang Guozhong to support the Shenji Army and suppress the Tiancefu, while secretly
        preparing his own army - the Wolf Teeth Army. At the same time, he realized the need to deal with the
        influential martial arts factions of the Central Plains, as he had witnessed the power and influence of the
        Cangjian Mountain Villa's famous swordsmen at a martial arts gathering. To truly seize control of the Central
        Plains, he knew that he had to eliminate this major threat from the martial arts community. It was at this
        crucial moment that a mysterious figure entered An Lushan's camp. And thus, the story of Jianwang 3 begins from
        this year."</p>

          in the fourth famous sword competition, which became famous in the Central Plains martial arts. But one year
          later, Xie Yunliu found out that Fujiwara Hirosu ordered Isto-ryu to do evil in the Central Plains under his
