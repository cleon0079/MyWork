# Playtesting Report

## 1. Testing Methodology
The playtesting aimed to assess the Cloud Rendering Toolkit’s effectiveness, usability, and performance. I have conducted tests with 14 participants, including programmers, game designers, visual artists, and students. Each participant was asked to complete specific tasks using the toolkit in Unity and then provide feedback through a structured online questionnaire. The questionnaire focused on three main areas:

- **Functionality**: How well the toolkit met the intended goals of realistic cloud rendering and visual effect enhancement.
- **Usability**: Participants’ experience with installation, setup, and adjusting toolkit parameters.
- **Performance**: The toolkit’s responsiveness, stability, and efficiency in various scenes.

Participants were encouraged to explore the toolkit’s customizable features, such as cloud density, scale, color, light scattering, and wind settings. Additionally, they were asked to experiment with multiple cloud types and observe the toolkit’s performance impact in complex scenes.

## 2. Results Analysis
Based on the survey responses, i have analyzed the feedback in each targeted area:

- **Functionality**:
  - The majority (64.3%) of participants reported that the toolkit successfully met the functional objectives, allowing them to create realistic and visually appealing cloud effects.
  - A notable 71.5% of users indicated that they could see practical applications for the toolkit in their projects, particularly for enhancing scene atmosphere in games and applications.

- **Usability**:
  - **Installation and Setup**: Most participants described the installation and setup process as easy, with 50% finding it straightforward. However, 41.7% encountered minor difficulties, particularly when interpreting certain parameters.
  - **Parameter Adjustments**: The customizable aspects of the toolkit, like cloud density, scale, and light scattering, were positively received. However, some users expressed confusion regarding the “Wind” and “Detail Cloud Wind” settings, indicating a need for more intuitive controls or clearer documentation on these parameters.

- **Performance**:
  - **Responsiveness and Stability**: The toolkit performed well, with 58.3% rating it as highly responsive and stable, with no reported crashes. However, minor frame drops were observed by some participants, especially in the scene view that outside of play mode.
  - **Resource Efficiency**: In large-scale scenes, 41.7% of users noticed a performance impact. Recommendations included optimizing memory and GPU usage for better real-time rendering performance in resource-intensive environments.
